## Description

For this project my initial plan was to create a First Person Shooter (FPS) in unreal engine with the oculus quest. Unfortunately I ran into some weird bugs with the quest and could only get unreal to present a blank screen no matter what I did. I would have liked to figure this out because I was really excited to make a VR FPS but I ran out of time. Instead I made a demo of what the game i imagined would have been like in VR but instead from unreal's first person template. I hope I can get at least partial credit for this demo, thank you for your understanding and enjoy. 



## How to play

To play these games you will have to open the project in unreal and hit the play button on each of the maps. The maps for these games are located in the content folder `Content/EvilSphereMap`, and `Content/EvilPillarMap`.


Currently there are two different maps for my game.


### 1. Evil Sphere Map
**Description**

This game consists of a small map with blind corners where small metal AI spheres are generated every 1 second to attack you. The object of the game is to shoot them so that they explode before they get to you. 

**Thoughts**

Unfortunately this map was a bit more time constrained than I would have liked since I ran out of time. Ideally I would have liked to include multiple levels like this where the player had a health bar and the spheres would spawn in waves instead of infinitely. 

### 2. Evil Pillar Map

**Description**

This game consists of a much larger map which looks like a large foggy feild. This is supposed to look more like a zombie game or maybe an alien game. In my opinion this map is way more fun since all the enemies come at you at once and they are much bigger so they can sometimes push you off the side of the map so theres a way to lose the game.

**Thoughts**

In this game I would have liked to have switched the explosion out for a puff of mist or maybe a creepy haunted house noise. I feel like that would have matched the aesthetic a bit more. 





## Final Report
### What I Learned

During this class I've gone from knowing absolutely nothing about unreal engine to being able to create my own game. This class was super fun and taught me a lot about designing UI's and creating fun games almost completely from scratch. In this project specifically I learned a lot about how to setup a project for VR despite not actually being able to get the thing running on the quest. I also learned how to make AI enemy's and how to make them attack the player which was really fun to mess around with. Overall this class and this final assignment have helped me a lot in learning new ways to use Unreal, blueprints and templates to make really fun games. Thank you for the really fun class and have an amazing christmas break!
